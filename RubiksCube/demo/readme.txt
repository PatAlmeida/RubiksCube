The cube starts with a random scramble and a quick demonstration of manually turning the sides using the keyboard.

When 'w' is pressed, the solving algorithm generates a sequence of moves to take the randomly scrambled cube to its solved position. Pressing 't' animates the solution by first re-scrambling the cube to the same state is was in before the solving algorithm started. Then at a faster turning speed, executes the moves in order to solve the cube.

Once the solve is finished, keys can be pressed to turn each side manually, using standard cube notation.
